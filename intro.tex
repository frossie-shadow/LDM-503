\section{Introduction \label{sect:intro}}
In this document  we outline the verification and validation approach for LSST Data Management. In addition we outline some of the high level test milestones. 


\subsection{Objectives \label{sect:objectives}}

We describes the test and verification approach for DM and describe  constraints and limitations in the testing to be performed. 
We also describe the validation tests to be performed on the partially and fully integrated system. 
We do not describe all tests in details but leave that to dedicated test plans.


\subsection{Scope \label{sect:scope}}

This provides the approach and plan for all od DM. It covers interfaces to DM but nothing outside of DM. 
This document will be updated in response to any  requirements updates.

\subsection{Assumptions}  
 We will run large scale Science Validations. A large amount of informal science validation will be done in the the teams and documented in technical notes, in this test plan we are looking for broad validation and specifically {\em operaability} i.e. can we run this system everyday for a long period of time (years).

\section{Test Items}

The test items covered in this test plan are \product \ and its constituent components:

\begin{itemize_single}
\item All the product - from KT diagrams

\item Interfaces  
\item Procedures like Data release
