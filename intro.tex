{\bf THERE IS ONLY ONE OF THESE YOU PROBABLY WANT AN STS}


\subsection{Objectives \label{sect:objectives}}

The Software Test Plan describes the system being tested, summarising the system context and decomposition. It sets out the test and verification approach for the system and describes constraints and limitations in the testing to be performed. The STP describes the unit and integration tests for the component modules of the system and describes the validation tests to be performed on the fully integrated system. 

\subsection{Scope \label{sect:scope}}

The Software Test Plan is to be executed by the CU prior to delivery to the DPC where the system will be operated. The DPC will execute integration and acceptance test involving this system within the context of the DPC processing systems.
This document will be updated during the different Gaia cycle phases, according to the requirements updates.

\subsection{Assumptions}  
This paragraph is optional. It describes the preliminary assumptions on which the overall testing strategy are based.
