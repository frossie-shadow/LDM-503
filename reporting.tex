\begin{itemize_single}
\item All of the test steps of the Test Case are completed and
\item All open SPRs from this Test Case agreed in Software Review Board are considered noncritical.
\end{itemize_single}

A Test Case will be considered ``Partially Passed'' when:
\begin{itemize_single}
\item Only a subset of all of the test steps in the Test Case are completed but the overall purpose of the test has been met and
\item Any critical SPRs from this Test Case agreed in Software Review Board are still not closed.
\end{itemize_single}
