Nightly &  Amazon & {\bf Nightly Tests} \newline 
Run all automated tests on all DM packages automatically. 
\\ \hline
Weekly & Amazon & {\bf Integration tests} \newline 
Basic Sanity check to make sure code compiles at no regressions have occurred and also pushing though a basic data set.
\\ \hline

TBP& NCSA & Interface tests \newline
The interface tests have to be planned and documented in a separate test plan that should include 
tests for each two parties on an interface (2by2 tests) as well as tests for all parties. Some of these will be covered again in E2E tests but before that we should be confident they work. {\bf This includes internal and external interfaces.}
\\ \hline

TBP & NCSA + IN2P3 & End to End Tests ?? Freeze software for Ops .. \url{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/Data+Processing+End+to+End+Testing}  What is the status of these ?
\\ \hline


F17 & NCSA & {\bf Science Platform with WISE data in PDAC}  \newline
SUIT continues PDAC development, adding the WISE data, further exercising the DAX dbserv and imgserv APIs, and taking advantage of metaserv once it becomes available
\\ \hline

F17 & NCSA& {\bf HSC reprocessing } \newline
Validate the data products withe LSST stack match or improve the HSC products - thus validating the stack.  
Validate the ops platform in NCSA. Validate some procedures like installing the stack, patches, starting, stopping production. Generate validation data set for weekly integration and other tests. 
\\ \hline

F17 &   & {\bf AP alert generation validation}\newline  
Validate AP alert generation stack performance on several DECam and HSC datasets.  Begin continuous integration testing. \\ \hline

S18 & NCSA? &  {\bf AP system validation}\newline
Validate AP alert distribution and mini-broker system fed by live or simulated live data. 
\\ \hline

2018 & NCSA & {\bf Spectrograph Data acquisition } \newline
\ldots  {\color{red} Do we need a test BEFORE THIS?}
\\ \hline

2018 &  NCSA & {\bf Operations rehearsal for commissioning }
With TBD weeks commissioning (lets say a week) - pick which parts of plan we could rehearse.
Chuck suggests Instrument Signal Removal should be the focus of this (or the next rehearsal).
\\ \hline

2019 & NCSA &  {\bf  Operations rehearsal \#2 for commissioning} 
More complete rehearsal - where do the scientist look at quality data? How do they feed it back to the Telescope ?
How do we create/update calibrations ? Exercises some of the control loops.
