\section{Validation Tests}
 Validation of the system though Oerations Rehersals (and or end to end tests)

\subsection{General strategy}

Description of the general verification and validation strategy, decomposition into verification testing categories (e.g. science tests, SP external interface tests, algorithms interrelation and sequence). Assessed validation tests results shall be available over the software development duration: they are stored into SVN repository along with related input data, property-file, etc.

A subset of tests are run at DPC during software release qualification process, the results of DPC runs are compared with corresponding test outputs. During DPC integration tests, these assessed outputs will also allow to verify software non-regression.
