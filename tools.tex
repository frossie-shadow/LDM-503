\section{Validation Tools}
\subsection{Introduction}

To evaluate the correctness of the generated data and the systems performances a set of tools may be developed or used. These
tools will provide the means to facilitate the validation tasks. 
Following subsections describe the various tools that can used in the \product validation (e.g. data comparison tools, analysis tools, etc).

\subsection{Data Comparison Tools}
This type of test tools are used to manage products in terms of:
\begin{itemize_single}
\item Comparison of a product generated during a test execution w.r.t. the relevant reference product
\item Non regression verification comparing output products generated by different versions of the same system
\item Measurement of quality degradation due to perturbed inputs
\end{itemize_single}
It allows:
\begin{itemize_single}
\item Product analysis
\item Decoding of generated product allowing to read the most significant data of the product itself
\item Visualisation of the values of a single selected field
\item Apply an accuracy to the comparison
\item Comparing specific parts of the products
\item Filtering using flags values
\end{itemize_single}

\subsection{Data Transformation Tools}
These tools allow the data to be transformed to other formatted data.

\subsection{Analysis Tools}
Descriptions of the performance monitoring tools, profilers, test coverage programs... used in the Performance evaluation tests.\\
