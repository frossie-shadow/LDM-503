\section{Roles and Reporting}

Tester report issues through Jira, but what other mechanisms will be used?

Who directs OPS rehearsals .. ?

Reports on rehearsals .. issues and

Handling failures - time lines for fix.


\begin{note}
  Not my section but a thought: System Engineering intends to capture commissioning tests through JIRA testing addons/plugins such as Kanoah. We could use some of these to capture functional tests for repeatability between operation rehearsals (they might be overkill for most tests though). --FE

\begin{note}
  Note that downstream text refers to ``Software Review Board''. We don't have such an entity so we need to either identify an existing entity or define the constitution of that Board.
