Each test specification must make clear who the {\em tester} is. 


Testers report issues through Jira and also write a test report. 
The test reports will be used to populate the verification control document see \secref{sect:approach}. 
At this time we are aware of some plans in System Engineering to use Jira plugins to track commissioning tests - we have to see how this might work for DM verification. 

Operations rehearsals require someone to direct them, these are more about the process than tests. The rehearsal can not be directed by the Operations Manger since that person has a major role in the rehearsal. Some external individual must be found to perform this role. 

Tests and procedures  will sometimes fail - a test specification may be rerun several times to get it correct. 

For large scale tests and rehearsals there should be a Test Review Board nominated to write up the findings as well as decide on timescales for rerunning part or all of a test in case of failure.
