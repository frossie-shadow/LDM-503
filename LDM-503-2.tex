\subsubsection{Open issues}

\begin{itemize}

\item{Check that data products generated with the LSST stack match or improve upon the equivalent HSC products.}

\item{Validate the ops platform in NCSA, including installing the stack, starting and stopping production.}

\item{Generate a validation data set for weekly integration and other tests.}

\end{itemize}

From the pipelines perspective, there's no new work involved here beyond the v13.0 release (at which point the HSC merge is complete and QA has been performed). Suggest we'd run this with the latest release as of the date of the test (so this is 14.N, where 14.0 is the end-of-S17 release).
Again from pipelines, detailed definition of the ``ops platform'' is not necessary.
Suggest that the plausible availability of services should drive the test plan in this case, rather than vice versa.
